# React Rocketseat

Welcome to the repository for the React track classes from [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). taught by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g)

## About

This repository contains the source code developed during the React track classes at RocketSeat. The goal is to track progress in the course and share solutions and learnings.

## Level 01 - Fundamentals

In this module, we will create a React application using Vite and learn about the most important concepts of React, including componentization, properties, states, immutability and hooks, as well as applying TypeScript to our project to add static typing to the application.

## Level 02 - Routes and HTTP

In this module we will build a complete application with routing and several important concepts from the React ecosystem such as ContextAPI, useReducer, immer and much more.

## Level 03 - Diving deep into hooks

In this module we will build a complete front-end web application, connecting to an API and we will see how to perform applications with React, understanding how the library's internal algorithms work and the entire component rendering flow.

## Level 04 - Integrating frontend with backend

This project focuses on practicing both the concepts we have seen about React and communication with APIs via HTTP requests. We will also introduce testing in frontend applications. Therefore, we will develop a management application for a pizzeria (admin dashboard) using Vite, React Router DOM, React Hook Form, shadcn/ui, React Query, Vitest and more!

## Level 05 - Next fundamentals

In this module, we will create a complete project with the Next.js framework. We will use StitchesJS, going through concepts of SPA, server-side rendering (SSR) and static-site generation (SSG).

## Level 06 - Design System

In this module we will build a Design System, understand how to document React components and discover several tools that will help us from implementing the Design System to publishing it, such as Storybook, changesets and much more.

[Class project](level-six/)

## Level 07 - Diving deep into Next.js

Using our Design System, we will create a complete application up to deployment. We will cover authenticated routes in Next.js, integration with Google Calendar, validations and much more!
